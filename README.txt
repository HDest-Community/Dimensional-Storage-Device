### Notes
- The Dimensional Storage Device can only be found in the wild.
- Loadout code is `dsd`.
- Some HDPickup items cannot be inserted into the backpack. That is intentional as there is no way to save some variables, which results in various exploits caused by packing and unpacking an item.
- Each player gets their own storage.
- Operation amount only affects magazines and HDPickup items (i.e. loose ammo and such). It does not work when inserting armor, but does when removing it.
- Storage has 10000 bulk limit. The device weighs 30% of what's in the storage. Don't ask me how that works or why. It's an AceCorp secret. Something with dimensional energies leaking through the device, I don't know, I don't get paid to write technical specifications.
