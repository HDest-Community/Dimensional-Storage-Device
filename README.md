### Notes
---
- Loadout code is `dsd`.
- Configuration codes are:
	- `cap`: overrides the starting storage capacity.
- Some HDPickup items cannot be inserted into the backpack. That is intentional as there is no way to save some variables, which results in various exploits caused by packing and unpacking an item.
- Each player gets their own storage.
- Order of items is First-In-First-Out. New items are put at the end of the list.
- Each operation costs 2 battery charges. Device will be useless without batteries.
- The device itself does not hold any items. Meaning two different devices will point to the same storage.
- To expand your storage, hold Zoom and Firemode when picking up a DSD to consume the item and gain extra storage
